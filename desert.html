<p class="ubuntu">A meerkat is a mammal and an omnivore. They have bushy brown striped fur. Its face is small and pointed with large eyes surrounded by dark patches. Long sharp claws help build their burrows, where they live. Interesting fact, they can recognize each other's voice. They start their day by grooming or laying in the sun. The rest of their day they just find food. One meerkat will watch the others meerkats back by signaling them when a predator comes.</p>
