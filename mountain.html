<p class="ubuntu">A caribou is a mammal and a herbivore. Has a long snout, a short tail, and long legs with big round hooves. On its throat this deer has a dewlap with white hair. Both of male and female has antlers, the male's antlers are larger though. Intersting fact, caribous are ungulate so they can walk in the deep snow. They snack on lichens and mushrooms. Travel up to 50 miles a day in herds.</p>

<p class="ubuntu">A snow leopard is a mammal and a carnivore. Its fur is very thick of grey and yellow and has spots. They have extra large paws to keep up with the snow. Also a long thick tail for balance. Interesting fact, snow leopards are more related to tigers than leopards. They eat anything they catch. For 18 hours they might be resting or sleeping. Hunting for them is a solo thing.</p>
