<p class="ubuntu">A narwhal is a mammal and a carnivore. According to one of the sources, <q>The narwhal looks like a cross between a whale and a unicorn with its long, spiraled tusk jutting from its head. Males most commonly have tusks, and some may even have two. The tusk, which can grow as long as 10 feet, is actually an enlarged tooth.</q> Interesting fact, narwhals can live up to fifty years. They travel in groups and eat. It is said that they can dive 800 meters down 18 to 25 times every day for six months.</p>

<p class="ubuntu">A walrus is a mammal and a carnivore. One of the sources say, <q>Walruses have large, flabby bodies covered in brown or pink skin. Short fur covers most of their bodies except for their fins. Their faces feature two small eyes, a mustache and two long tusks. Interesting fact, the tusks keep growing throughout their living.</q> They hang out with each other on rocky shores or a sheet of ice. When walruses dive in the water they use their tusks to find food when its dark.</p>
